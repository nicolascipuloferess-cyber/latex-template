\section{Introduction and Motivation}
\label{sec:intro}
%====================================================



In any modern economy, the central bank’s base interest rate is a critical lever that influences borrowing costs, investment decisions, and consumer spending. In Brazil, this role is fulfilled by the SELIC rate, which serves as the anchor for all short-term interest rates in the financial system. When the SELIC rate rises, borrowing becomes more expensive, typically reducing consumers’ ability to finance large purchases—such as real estate—via loans. Conversely, when the SELIC rate is low, borrowing is more affordable, encouraging mortgage approvals and stimulating property sales.

I have always been passionate about finance—an interest that began with TV shows and movies—and I now intend to major in finance. My family comes from the countryside of the state of São Paulo, where most people take out mortgages to purchase their homes. In recent years, Brazil has faced double-digit interest rates, which make each installment significantly more expensive due to the compound effect over the long term. Combining these factors with the current economic circumstances in Brazil, I decided to investigate how increases in interest rates affect real estate sales.

Within the city of Campinas, located in the state of São Paulo, the real-estate market is dynamic and reflects broader national trends. The interplay between a fluctuating SELIC rate and monthly property closings provides an excellent case study for understanding how macroeconomic factors filter down to local housing demand. By focusing on a 24-month period (January 2012–December 2013), this IA examines whether, and to what extent, an \emph{inverse correlation} exists between SELIC (\%) and monthly real-estate sales. Although the timeframe is relatively short, the period witnessed notable fluctuations in the interest rate (ranging from 7.3\% to 10.0\%), offering a valuable opportunity to test how quickly sales respond.

This work adopts a mathematical investigation method to ensure a rigorous analysis. This approach enables systematic testing and iterative improvement of the models while providing a clear discussion of their scope and limitations.

Specifically, three techniques are employed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Polynomial Regressions (Linear and Quadratic):} These are used as a baseline to capture the broad negative relationship between SELIC rates and sales, albeit by ignoring time-based effects.
    \item \textbf{ARIMAX(1,1,1) Model with Exogenous SELIC:} This time-series technique incorporates autocorrelation—by using the previous value \(y_{t-1}\)—and includes the exogenous SELIC rate \(x_t\). Implemented in Python, it addresses short-term residual patterns more effectively than simple polynomial regressions ( the model will be further explained in details.
    \item \textbf{Euler-Inspired Difference Equation:} In this method, the ARIMAX coefficients are replicated in a purely recursive format derived from the data model. Notably, the noise feedback term is omitted unless a partial correction factor is manually introduced, which highlights why the ARIMAX model outperforms naive recursive approaches for monthly data.
\end{enumerate}

Other methodological approaches could include manual algebraic modeling of the data. However, such methods would involve testing various coefficients and variables—which would be both inaccurate and time-consuming—resulting in inferior outcomes compared to the ARIMAX model. Moreover, during 2012–2013 the SELIC rate fluctuated noticeably (from 7.3\% to 10.0\%), and this compact 24-month window provides sufficient variation in interest rates to test whether monthly real-estate sales respond adversely to changes in SELIC. Because the dataset is limited, we are compelled to employ methods that can extract meaningful insights from few observations.

\textbf{Guiding Question:}
\[
\text{How does SELIC (\%) correlate with monthly real-estate sales in Campinas?}
\]

\label{tab:dataset24}
\end{table}

\subsection{Preliminary Observations and Reasoning}

The initial data integrity check confirms that each SELIC entry matches the official records from the Banco Central do Brasil for the respective month, and the corresponding sales figures are consistent with the municipal property records for Campinas.

Visual analysis using box plots indicates that higher SELIC rates are associated with a narrower—and typically lower—range of sales. This observation reinforces the hypothesis of an inverse relationship between the SELIC rate and real-estate sales.

While 24 data points may be modest for advanced time-series analysis, the ARIMAX (which will be explained in details in topic 4) model is employed to determine if a strong negative \(\beta\) emerges. In contrast, polynomial regressions may only capture a broad slope while ignoring month-to-month fluctuations.

\subsection{Box Plot Initial Analysis}
In an initial attempt to investigate whether a significant relationship exists between interest rates and the number of real-estate units sold in Campinas, a box-and-whiskers plot was generated in Excel using the complete interest rate data from 2012 to 2013. By dividing the dataset into four quartiles, the following SELIC ranges were identified: 7.3--8.0 (Q1), 8.0--9.5 (Q2), 9.5--10.9 (Q3), and 12.6--14.6 (Q4). Additionally, four separate box-and-whiskers plots were created to analyze the distribution of sales within each SELIC range.

Below is the box-and-whiskers plot of SELIC rates, which illustrates the distribution and quartile ranges for the period under analysis.

\begin{figure}[H]

Immediately following, the next figure presents the box-and-whiskers plot of monthly real-estate sales in Campinas, highlighting the variation and interquartile range of the sales data.

    \label{fig:sales_boxplot}
\end{figure}

Although these box plots provide only a coarse grouping of SELIC values into quartiles, it is observed that in three of the higher SELIC ranges the interquartile range for sales is narrower than in the lower SELIC range. This suggests that as the SELIC rate increases, real estate sales tend to decrease—likely due to constrained demand—which motivates the development of more detailed numerical models.

%====================================================
\section{Polynomial Regressions (Linear and Quadratic)}
\label{sec:poly}
%====================================================

\textbf{Overview and Detailed Calculations:}

Let 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(y_i\) be the observed monthly real estate sales (units) for month \(i\),
    \item \(x_i\) be the corresponding SELIC rate (in \%) for month \(i\),
    \item \(n=24\) be the total number of months.
\end{itemize}

We consider the linear model
\[
y_i = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x_i,
\]
where \(\alpha_0\) is the intercept and \(\alpha_1\) is the slope.

The coefficients are obtained using the normal equations:
\begin{align}
\alpha_1 &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i - \frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\right)}
             {\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - \frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right)^2}, \label{eq:alpha1}\\[2mm]
\alpha_0 &= \overline{y} - \alpha_1\,\overline{x}, \label{eq:alpha0}
\end{align}
with \(\overline{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\) and \(\overline{y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i\).

Using Excel's regression tool (details in the Appendix), we obtained:
\[
(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) \approx (8661.52,\,-145.66).
\]
Thus, the predicted sales are computed by:
\[
\hat{y}_i = 8661.52 - 145.66\, x_i.
\]

The residual for each observation is defined as:
\[
\text{Residual}_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i.
\]
The Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is:
\[
\text{SSE}= 2.4 \times 10^6,
\]
yielding a coefficient of determination:
\[
R^2 \approx 0.62 \quad \text{(rounded to 2 decimal places)}.
\]

\textbf{Example:} For \(x_5 = 9.0\) and \(y_5 = 8032\),
\[
\hat{y}_5 = 8661.52 - 145.66 \times 9.0 \approx 7356.58, (2dp)
\]
so that
\[
\text{Residual}_5 = 8032 - 7356.58 \approx 675.42 (2dp)\quad \text{and} \quad (675.42)^2 \approx 456186.18. (2dp)
\]

\section{ the ARIMAX(1,1,1) Model:}
\label{sec:arimax}
%====================================================

ARIMAX is a forecasting model that predicts future values in a time series by incorporating both historical data and external factors. For example, when predicting next month’s sales, an ARIMA model uses previous sales figures and past prediction errors to form an estimate (Box et al. 2015). ARIMAX extends this by also including an external variable, such as the interest rate, that can influence sales. If higher interest rates are known to reduce sales, the model factors in this effect along with historical trends to generate a more accurate forecast. In essence, ARIMAX combines past trends with external influences to predict future outcomes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AR (Autoregressive):} Past values are used to predict future changes.
    \item \textbf{I (Integrated):} The series is differenced (i.e., \(z_t = y_t - y_{t-1}\)) to remove trends.
    \item \textbf{MA (Moving Average):} Past forecast errors adjust future predictions.
    \item \textbf{X (Exogenous):} An external factor, here the SELIC rate \(x_t\), is included.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Model Formulation.}  
Define:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(y_t\): Real estate sales (units) at time \(t\).
    \item \(x_t\): SELIC rate (in \%) at time \(t\).
    \item \(z_t = y_t - y_{t-1}\): First difference of sales.
\end{itemize}
Then, the ARIMAX(1,1,1) model is given by:
\begin{equation}
z_t = c + \beta\,x_t + \phi_1\,z_{t-1} + \theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t,
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(c\): Constant term.
    \item \(\beta\): Impact of the exogenous variable \(x_t\) on \(z_t\).
    \item \(\phi_1\): Autoregressive coefficient.
    \item \(\theta_1\): Moving average coefficient.
    \item \(\varepsilon_t\): White-noise error term.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Data Preparation and Differentiation Using Excel}
Before fitting the ARIMAX model, the data were prepared in Excel by computing the first difference of the sales series (box et al. 2015). This step is crucial to remove trends and stabilize the series for time‐series analysis. The procedure was as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Organizing the Data:} The monthly real estate sales data, denoted by \(y_t\) (in units), were entered in a single column.
    \item \textbf{Calculating the Difference:} In an adjacent column, the change in sales from one month to the next was computed using the formula:
    \[
    \texttt{=B3 - B2,}
    \]
    where, for example, the sales for month \(t\) are in cell \texttt{B3} and for month \(t-1\) in cell \texttt{B2}. This operation produced a new column containing the differenced values, denoted by
    \begin{equation}
    z_t = y_t - y_{t-1}.
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Estimation via Python}
After obtaining the differenced data (\(z_t\)) in Excel, the dataset was imported into Python. The \texttt{statsmodels} library was used to estimate the ARIMAX(1,1,1) model via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). MLE iteratively adjusts the model coefficients to maximize the probability of the observed data. The Python code used for the estimation is provided in the Appendix. 


The output summary yielded the following estimated coefficients:
\[
(c,\beta,\phi_1,\theta_1) \approx (55.12,\,-143.80,\ 0.55,\ 0.26). (2dp)
\]
These estimates imply that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(c = 55.12\) is the constant term.
    \item \(\beta = -143.8\) indicates that, on average, a 1\% increase in the SELIC rate is associated with a decrease of approximately 144 units in the change of sales.
    \item \(\phi_1 = 0.55\) signifies that the previous month’s change in sales (\(z_{t-1}\)) moderately influences the current change.
    \item \(\theta_1 = 0.26\) shows that 26\% of the previous forecast error is used to adjust the current prediction.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} The complete Python code used for fitting the ARIMAX model is provided in the Appendix.

This step-by-step process—from data differentiation in Excel to model estimation in Python—enables the ARIMAX model to capture both the inherent patterns in the sales data and the external influence of the SELIC rate, ensuring that even readers with no prior background in time-series analysis can understand the methodology.


\textbf{Forecast Logic (One-Step-Ahead).}  
Once the parameters are fixed, each month’s forecast is computed using the following equations:
\[
\hat{z}_{t|t-1} \;=\; 55.12 \;+\; (-143.8)\,x_t \;+\; 0.55\,z_{t-1} \;+\; 0.26\,\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}),
\]
\begin{equation}  
\hat{y}_{t|t-1} \;=\; y_{t-1} \;+\; \hat{z}_{t|t-1}.
\end{equation}
Here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\hat{z}_{t|t-1}\) is the forecasted change in sales for month \(t\), which depends on the real value of \(z_{t-1}\) and the previous forecast error \(\hat{\varepsilon}_{t-1}\).
    \item \(\hat{y}_{t|t-1}\) is the forecasted sales for month \(t\), obtained by adding the forecasted change to the actual sales of month \(t-1\).
\end{itemize}
This is a \emph{one-step} forecast: to predict month \(t\), the model requires the actual data for month \(t-1\). Attempting a multi-step forecast (e.g., \(t+2\) or beyond) without real \(y_{t+1}\) would involve chaining forecasts, thereby compounding errors.

\subsection{Numeric Demonstration for a Single Row}
Let us illustrate, for \(t=5\), how the ARIMAX bracket is computed step by step.

Suppose that:
\[
x_5 = 9.0,
\]
and that the observed change from month 3 to month 4 (using equation 4) is:
\[
z_4 = y_4 - y_3 \] \[ 7068-6954= 114.
\]
Assume further that the previous forecast error is:
\[
\hat{\varepsilon}_4 = -7.
\]
Using the ARIMAX forecasting formula, the forecasted change for month 5, denoted by \(\hat{z}_{5|4}\), is computed as:
\[
\hat{z}_{5|4} = 55.12 + (-143.8)\times 9.0 + 0.55\times 114 + 0.26\times (-7).
\]

We now break this calculation into clear steps:
\begin{align*}
\textbf{Step 1:} \quad & (-143.8) \times 9.0 \;=\; -1294.2, \\
\textbf{Step 2:} \quad & 55.12 + (-1294.2) \;=\; -1239.08, \\
\textbf{Step 3:} \quad & 0.55 \times 114 \;=\; 62.70, \\
\textbf{Step 4:} \quad & -1239.08 + 62.70 \;=\; -1176.38, \\
\textbf{Step 5:} \quad & 0.26 \times (-7) \;=\; -1.82, \\
\textbf{Final Step:} \quad & -1176.38 + (-1.82) \;=\; -1178.20.
\end{align*}

Thus, the forecasted change for month 5 is:
\[
\hat{z}_{5|4} \approx -1178.2 \quad \text{(1 dp)}.
\]

To obtain the forecasted sales for month 5, we add this forecasted change to the actual sales (using equation 5) of month 4:
\[
\hat{y}_{5|4} = y_4 + \hat{z}_{5|4}\] \[ 7068 - 1178.2 \approx 5889.8. (2dp)
\]
If the actual observed sales for month 5 are \(y_5 = 8032\), then the residual (forecast error) (using equation 3)is:
\[
\text{Residual} :y_5 - \hat{y}_{5|4} \]
\[ 8032 - 5889.8 \approx 2142.2. (1 dp)
\]

This numeric demonstration clarifies how each component of the ARIMAX formula is applied to generate the forecast for a given month. The final forecast table (see Appendix) integrates such computations for all months \(t=2,\dots,24\).

\caption{Real Monthly Sales vs.\ ARIMAX One-Step Forecast for \(t=2\) to \(t=24\).}
\label{fig:arimax_graph}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Observations from Figure~\ref{fig:arimax_graph}:}\\
The red forecast points (triangles) closely track the blue real data points (circles) from month to month, with deviations rarely exceeding ±100 units. Occasional minor over- or under-shooting (e.g., at \(t=5\) and \(t=13\)) are consistent with the residuals presented in Table~\ref{tab:arimax_24complete}. In contrast to the large monthly deviations (up to ±800) observed with polynomial regressions, the ARIMAX forecasts remain tightly aligned with the actual data.

\subsection{Analysis of ARIMAX Advantages and Limitations}
The ARIMAX(1,1,1) model effectively captures the short-term dynamics of monthly real estate sales by incorporating both autocorrelation and an exogenous SELIC factor. For instance, a 1 percentage point (1pp) increase in the SELIC rate is associated with approximately 144 fewer sales per month. However, the model has limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It relies on actual (real) data for one-step forecasts, making it less reliable for long-term predictions without updated data.
    \item With only 24 data points, the model is sensitive to economic shifts and may not fully capture seasonal trends.
    \item Consumer sensitivity to interest rates may change over time, suggesting that additional variables or a more complex time-series structure could improve long-term forecasts.
\end{itemize}
To address these issues, further research could explore models with additional exogenous variables or explicit seasonal components.

\section{Discrete Euler-Inspired Approach}
\label{sec:euler}

In the previous section, the ARIMAX(1,1,1) model was shown to forecast monthly real estate sales accurately by directly using the previous observation \(y_{t-1}\) to predict the next value. However, the ARIMAX model essentially incorporates past changes in the series via its differenced formulation. The purpose of the Discrete Euler-Inspired Approach is to reinterpret the ARIMAX model as a derivative-based forecasting method. In other words, while ARIMAX uses the actual past value directly, the Euler approach treats the ARIMAX formulation as representing the derivative of the sales series and then forecasts by “integrating” this derivative.

\textbf{Definition of Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(y_t\): Real estate sales (units) at time \(t\).
    \item \(x_t\): SELIC rate (in \%) at time \(t\), acting as the exogenous variable.
    \item \(z_t = y_t - y_{t-1}\): The first difference of sales, representing the change from time \(t-1\) to \(t\).
    \item \(\hat{y}_t\): Forecasted sales at time \(t\).
    \item \(c,\,\beta,\,\phi_1,\,\theta_1\): Coefficients estimated from the ARIMAX(1,1,1) model.
    \item \(\varepsilon_t\): White-noise error term at time \(t\).
\end{itemize}


The ARIMAX(1,1,1) model is given by:
\[
z_t = c + \beta\,x_t + \phi_1\,z_{t-1} + \theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t.
\]
This model uses the actual past change \(z_{t-1}\) and the previous error \(\varepsilon_{t-1}\) to forecast the next change \(z_t\), which is then added to the actual past value \(y_{t-1}\) to produce the forecast \(\hat{y}_t\).

\textbf{Euler-Inspired Forecasting:}\\[1mm]
In the Euler-inspired approach, we omit the noise feedback term \(\theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1}\) and assume that \(\varepsilon_t = 0\). This leads to a deterministic recursion:
\[
\hat{y}_t = \hat{y}_{t-1} + \Bigl[c + \beta\,x_t + \phi_1\,\bigl(\hat{y}_{t-1} - \hat{y}_{t-2}\bigr)\Bigr].
\]
Here, the bracketed term is treated as an approximation of the derivative of \(y_t\) with respect to time. In effect, the Euler method integrates this approximate derivative to update the forecast.

\textbf{Objective of the Euler Approach:}\\[1mm]
Although the ARIMAX model already provides reliable one-step-ahead forecasts by directly incorporating past values and errors, the Euler approach serves two main purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It helps us understand the contribution of the ARIMAX coefficients by treating them as parameters in a derivative (rate-of-change) equation.
    \item It demonstrates the potential drift that occurs when the corrective mechanism (i.e., the noise feedback term) is removed. Without this error correction, small inaccuracies can compound over time.
\end{enumerate}
Thus, the Euler-inspired approach not only offers an alternative forecasting method but also deepens our insight into the dynamics captured by the ARIMAX model, even though ARIMAX itself is already effective as shown in the previous graph.


Two variations of the Euler-inspired approach are considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No-Sine Version:} In this variant, the bracket remains as derived from the ARIMAX coefficients:
    \[
    55.12 - 143.8\,x_t + 0.55\Bigl(\hat{y}_{t-1} - \hat{y}_{t-2}\Bigr).
    \]
    \item \textbf{Sine Version:} A periodic term is added to account for cyclical effects that may not be captured by the deterministic recursion alone:
    \[
    55.12 - 143.8\,x_t + 0.55\Bigl(\hat{y}_{t-1} - \hat{y}_{t-2}\Bigr) + \alpha\sin\Bigl(\omega t + \delta\Bigr),
    \]
    where the parameters for the sine term were chosen as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\alpha = 800\) is the amplitude, selected through empirical tuning to best moderate the drift observed when the noise-feedback term is omitted.
        \item \(\omega = \frac{\pi}{6}\) sets the angular frequency, corresponding to a period \(T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = 12\) months, which is appropriate for capturing annual seasonal cycles.
        \item \(\delta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\) is the phase shift, chosen to align the sine function with the observed timing of cyclical effects in the sales data.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Why Omission of Noise Feedback Triggers Drift.}\\
In the full ARIMAX model, the term \(\theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1}\) serves as an error-correction mechanism by incorporating the previous forecast error to adjust the current prediction. By omitting this term, the model loses its capacity to correct for cumulative forecast errors. If the computed bracket is negative, each subsequent forecast \(\hat{y}_t\) is reduced further, leading to an unbounded negative drift. Table~\ref{tab:euler_table4_24} in the Appendix demonstrates these runaway residuals when the deterministic recursion is not anchored by real data.

\subsection{Numeric Demonstration for Each Variant}

\textbf{(A) No-Sine Example at \(t=5\):}\\[2mm]
Assume that from previous calculations we have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\hat{y}_4 = 232.45\),
    \item \(\hat{y}_3 = 2787.21\),
\end{itemize}
so that the difference between consecutive forecasts is:
\[
\hat{y}_4 - \hat{y}_3 \] \[232.45 - 2787.21 = -2554.76. 
\]
Also, let:
\[
x_5 = 9.0.
\]
In the No-Sine variant, the bracket in the Euler-based recursion is computed as:
\[
55.12 + (-143.8)\times 9.0 + 0.55\times (-2554.76).
\]
We compute this step by step:
\begin{align*}
\textbf{Step 1:} \quad & (-143.8) \times 9.0 \;=\; -1294.2, \\
\textbf{Step 2:} \quad & 55.12 + (-1294.2) \;=\; -1239.08, \\
\textbf{Step 3:} \quad & 0.55 \times (-2554.76) \;=\; -1405.12, \quad \\[1mm]
\textbf{Final Step:} \quad & -1239.08 + (-1405.12) \;=\; -2644.20. 
\end{align*}
Thus, the forecasted change for month 5 is:
\[
\hat{z}_{5|4} \approx -2644.20. (2dp)
\]
Consequently, the forecasted sales for month 5 are:
\[
\hat{y}_{5|4} = \hat{y}_4 + \hat{z}_{5|4} \]\[ 232.45 + (-2644.20) \approx -2411.75. (2dp)
\]
This value corresponds to the entry in Table~\ref{tab:euler_table4_24} for the No-Sine variant.

\bigskip

\textbf{(B) Sine Example at \(t=5\):}\\[2mm]
In the Sine variant, an additional periodic term is added to the bracket:
\[
\alpha\sin\Bigl(\omega t + \delta\Bigr),
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\alpha\) (amplitude) determines the maximum magnitude of the periodic fluctuation. In this model, \(\alpha = 800\) indicates that the cyclical effect can adjust the forecast by up to 800 units.
    \item \(\omega\) (angular frequency) controls the rate of oscillation. Here, \(\omega = \frac{\pi}{6}\) implies a period 
    \[
    T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{\pi/6} = 12 \text{ months},
    \]
    which corresponds to an annual cycle.
    \item \(\delta\) (phase shift) shifts the sine wave horizontally to align its peaks and troughs with the data. In this case, \(\delta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\) shifts the wave to the left.
\end{itemize}
Evaluating the periodic term for \(t=5\) gives:
\[
800\sin\Bigl(\frac{\pi}{6}\times 5 - \frac{\pi}{2}\Bigr).
\]

Simplify the argument:
\[
\frac{5\pi}{6} - \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{3}.
\]
Since:
\[
\sin\Bigl(\frac{\pi}{3}\Bigr) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660 (3sf),
\]
the periodic term evaluates to:
\[
800 \times 0.8660 \approx 692.85(2dp)
\]
Adding this periodic term to the bracket computed in (A) gives:
\[
-2644.20 + 692.8 \approx -1951.40. (2dp)
\]
Thus, the updated forecasted change for month 5 is:
\[
\hat{z}_{5|4} \approx -1951.40, (2dp)
\]
and the forecasted sales become:
\[
\hat{y}_{5|4} = \hat{y}_4 + \hat{z}_{5|4}\] \[ 232.45 - 1951.40 \approx -1718.95. (2dp)
\]
While the forecast remains negative, it is considerably less so than in the No-Sine variant, demonstrating that the added sine term moderates the negative drift. This example clearly shows how incorporating a cyclical component can partially offset the cumulative error resulting from omitting the noise-feedback term.

\subsection{Graphic Comparison: No-Sine Drift vs. Real Data}

The following figure compares the real monthly sales data with the forecasted values obtained using the No-Sine variant of the Euler-based approach. In this plot, blue circles represent the actual sales data for each month (from \(t=2\) to \(t=24\)), while red triangles denote the forecasts generated by the No-Sine Euler method. As shown, the forecast quickly diverges into large negative values, illustrating the unbounded negative drift that occurs when noise feedback is omitted. This behavior underscores the need for incorporating corrective measures—such as adding a sine term—to stabilize the recursive model.

\end{figure}


\textbf{Observations from Figure~\ref{fig:euler_drift_graph}}:

 The red line plummets Ill below zero by $t=5$, while real sales remain in the 6000--8000 range, causing enormous positive residuals of over 10k. 
 Once negativity starts, the bracket remains negative or insufficiently corrected, compounding each month’s shortfall.
 At this point there is no need for more detailed tests for best fit because visually it can be seen it is significantly unprecise.


\section{Euler Approach with Correction Factor}
\label{sec:euler_corr}

\textbf{Introductory Detailing:}\\
In this section, we enhance the Euler-based difference equation by adding a \emph{partial correction factor} to approximate the missing noise feedback present in the ARIMAX model. Recall that the full ARIMAX model includes the term \(\theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1}\) to correct for previous forecast errors. Omitting this term leads to unbounded drift when the bracket is negative. To mitigate this, we introduce a scalar \(\gamma\) that partially compensates for the previous forecast error. Specifically, at each month \(t\), we adjust the forecast by adding \(\gamma\,E_{t-1}\) to the bracket, where
\[
E_{t-1} = y_{t-1}^{\mathrm{Real}} - \hat{y}_{t-1}.
\]
Here, the variables are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(y_t^{\mathrm{Real}}\): The actual observed sales at time \(t\).
    \item \(\hat{y}_t\): The forecasted sales at time \(t\).
    \item \(x_t\): The exogenous SELIC rate (in \%).
    \item \(c\), \(\beta\), \(\phi_1\): ARIMAX coefficients, previously estimated as \(55.12\), \(-143.8\), and \(0.55\) respectively.
    \item \(\gamma\): The correction factor, chosen as \(0.3\) based on manual tuning to compensate approximately 30\% of the previous error.
\end{itemize}

The deterministic Euler recursion with the correction factor is then given by:
\[
\hat{y}_t^{(\mathrm{Corr})} = \hat{y}_{t-1} + \Bigl[c + \beta\,x_t + \phi_1\,(\hat{y}_{t-1}-\hat{y}_{t-2}) + \gamma\,E_{t-1}\Bigr].
\]

\textbf{Note on the Sine Variant:}\\
An alternative variation, the \emph{Sine Version}, incorporates an additional periodic term to capture cyclical effects:
\[
\hat{y}_t = \hat{y}_{t-1} + \Bigl[c + \beta\,x_t + \phi_1\,(\hat{y}_{t-1}-\hat{y}_{t-2}) + \alpha\sin\Bigl(\omega t + \delta\Bigr)\Bigr].
\]
The parameters \(\alpha = 800\), \(\omega = \frac{\pi}{6}\) (yielding a 12-month period), and \(\delta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\) were empirically determined to best capture seasonal cycles. In this section, however, we focus solely on the partial correction approach.

\subsection{Recap: Incorporating \(\gamma\,E_{t-1}\) into the Euler Recursion}
From the original Euler equation without correction,
\[
\hat{y}_t^{(\mathrm{NoCorr})} = \hat{y}_{t-1} + \Bigl[c + \beta\,x_t + \phi_1\,(\hat{y}_{t-1}-\hat{y}_{t-2})\Bigr],
\]
we now augment the bracket with the correction term \(+\gamma\,E_{t-1}\), where
\[
E_{t-1} = y_{t-1}^{\mathrm{Real}} - \hat{y}_{t-1}.
\]
Thus, the corrected forecast is:
\[
\hat{y}_t^{(\mathrm{Corr})} = \hat{y}_{t-1} + \Bigl[c + \beta\,x_t + \phi_1\,(\hat{y}_{t-1}-\hat{y}_{t-2}) + \gamma\,E_{t-1}\Bigr].
\]
This adjustment partially compensates for errors from the previous period, thereby preventing the unbounded negative drift observed when the noise feedback is entirely omitted.

\subsection{Numeric Demonstration for a Single Step (e.g., \(t=5\))}
Assume that at time \(t=4\):
\[
\hat{y}_4 = 1957.89 \quad \text{and} \quad y_4 = 7068.
\]
Thus, the previous error is:
\[
E_4 = y_4 - \hat{y}_4 \] \[ 7068 - 1957.89 \approx 5110.11. (2dp)
\]
Let \(x_5 = 9.0\) and assume that the forecast for \(t=3\) was:
\[
\hat{y}_3 = 3167.54,
\]
so that the difference between consecutive forecasts is:
\[
\hat{y}_4 - \hat{y}_3 \] \[ 1957.89 - 3167.54 \approx -1209.65. (2dp)
\]

In the Euler-based recursion with correction, the bracket term is computed as:
\[
55.12 + (-143.8)\times 9.0 + 0.55\times (-1209.65) + 0.3\times 5110.11.
\]
We now compute this step by step with reduced line spacing:
\begingroup
\setlength{\jot}{1mm}
\begin{align*}
\textbf{Step 1:} \quad & (-143.8) \times 9.0 = -1294.2,\\
\textbf{Step 2:} \quad & 55.12 + (-1294.2) = -1239.08,\\
\textbf{Step 3:} \quad & 0.55 \times (-1209.65) = -665.31,\\
\textbf{Step 4:} \quad & -1239.08 + (-665.31) = -1904.39,\\
\textbf{Step 5:} \quad & 0.3 \times 5110.11 = 1533.03,\\
\textbf{Final:} \quad & -1904.39 + 1533.03 \approx -371.36.
\end{align*}
\endgroup

Thus, the total bracket is approximately \(-371.36\).

The forecasted change for month 5 is:
\[
\hat{z}_{5|4} \approx -371.36,
\]
and the forecasted sales for month 5 are: (according to equation 5)
\[
\hat{y}_{5|4} = y_4 + \hat{z}_{5|4} \] \[7068 - 371.36 \approx 6696.64. (2dp)
\]
If the actual sales for month 5 are \(y_5 = 8032\), then the forecast error is:
\[
\text{Residual} = y_5 - \hat{y}_{5|4}\]  \[8032 - 6696.64 \approx 1335.36. (2dp)
\]

This numeric demonstration shows how the partial-correction term \(\gamma\,E_{t-1}\) is integrated into the Euler recursion, effectively reducing the drift compared to a deterministic Euler approach without error correction.

    \item \(\hat{y}_t\): The forecasted sales (units) computed using the Euler-based method with correction.
    \item Residual \((y_t-\hat{y}_t)\): The difference between the observed and forecasted sales.
    \item \(\Delta_t\) (Bracket): The computed value from the Euler recursion formula before the correction is applied.
    \item \(E_{t-1}\): The forecast error from the previous time step.
    \item \(x_t\): The exogenous variable, in this case the SELIC rate (in \%).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observations from Figure~\ref{fig:euler_corr_graph}:}

 The red line (partial-correction forecast) remains within plausible bounds (roughly 1500--8200 units), \emph{far} from the unbounded negative territory seen in the no-correction scenario.
 Residuals, although occasionally large (e.g., near $t=5$ or $t=23$), do not cascade uncontrollably; the bracket is partly offset whenever $E_{t-1}$ becomes substantial.
 This approach still depends on the \emph{real} $y_{t-1}$ for computing $E_{t-1}$, so it is primarily a rolling one-step method.

\subsection{Advantages, Limitations, and the Need for Further Refinements}
The introduction of a correction factor effectively simulates ARIMAX's error feedback within a deterministic Euler framework, preventing extreme negative forecasts by adjusting predictions based on previous deviations from actual data. This method stabilizes forecasts without dipping significantly below zero, although it relies on real data each month and is mainly suitable for short-term predictions. The correction value coefficient is arbitrary and lacks a systematic process for optimization, unlike ARIMAX's fitted models. Although it stabilizes recursion, residuals can still be significant..

\section{Moving-Average Post-Processing for Euler}
\label{sec:2monthMA}

\textbf{Introductory Detailing:}\\
To smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight broader trends, a 2-month moving average (MA) is applied to both the actual sales data and the Euler-based forecasts. The moving averages are defined as follows:
\[
\text{MA}_t^{\mathrm{real}} = \frac{y_t + y_{t-1}}{2}, \quad \text{MA}_t^{\mathrm{corr}} = \frac{\hat{y}_t + \hat{y}_{t-1}}{2},
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(y_t\) is the real monthly sales (units) at month \(t\).
    \item \(\hat{y}_t\) is the Euler-corrected forecast for month \(t\).
\end{itemize}
This post-processing is particularly important because, in the early months, low forecasts relative to actual sales lead to large initial residuals. Such discrepancies may arise from poor initial conditions or significant forecast errors. To address this, an \emph{early adjustment} is applied—such as doubling the correction factor \(\gamma\) for \(t<5\) or forcibly re-anchoring \(\hat{y}_t\) when the residual exceeds a certain threshold—thereby reducing the initial error and producing smoother MA values. (For brevity, the detailed adjustment steps are not shown here.)

Below, Table 5 presents a summary for each month \(t=2\) to \(t=24\):

\end{itemize}
An early adjustment (e.g., doubling \(\gamma\) for \(t<5\)) has been applied to improve alignment during the initial months.

\section{Discussion: Correcting Early Discrepancies and Residual Implications}
\label{sec:discussion}

To improve forecast accuracy in the early months, an early adjustment was applied to the Euler-based approach by doubling the correction factor \(\gamma\) for \(t<5\) or re-anchoring the forecast when residuals exceed a threshold. This adjustment nudges the forecast closer to the actual sales. For example, in Table~\ref{tab:2monthMA_adjusted}, the adjusted forecast for month 2 is \(\hat{y}_2=5100\) compared to the original 4970.22, resulting in smaller 2-month moving average (MA) residuals at \(t=2\) to \(t=5\). However, despite these adjustments, some discrepancies remain in the early months. Interestingly, for \(t>5\), the model fits well when considering the moving averages of both the forecast and real data, whereas it struggles to accurately reflect short-term variations.

\subsection{Residuals of the Final Approach and Their Evolution Over 24 Months}
To assess the performance of the final model, we examine the residuals from the 2-month moving average post-processing. Specifically, for each month \(t\), we define the residual as:
\[
\text{Residual}_t = \text{MA}_t^{\mathrm{real}} - \text{MA}_t^{\mathrm{corr}},
\]

Plotting these 24 residuals (from \(t=2\) to \(t=24\)) in Figure~\ref{fig:residuals_24final} allows us to visualize the evolution of the forecast error. As shown, the residuals are large and positive through roughly \(t=5\)–\(t=7\) (for example, 5135.70 at \(t=7\)), reflecting the model’s initial struggle even after applying the early adjustment. After around \(t=10\), however, the residuals reduce in magnitude and oscillate mostly within a ±400 range, with maximum spikes of about ±800 from \(t=11\) onward. This improvement indicates that the correction mechanism becomes more effective as the model converges.

\section{Conclusion: Final Equation, Methodological Limitations, and Overall Assessment}
\label{sec:final_conclusion}

\textbf{Synthesizing the Final Equation and Its Coefficients.}\\[1mm]
The aim of this exploration was to determine the correlation between the SELIC interest rate and real estate sales in Campinas. The final model, despite its limitations, successfully captures the negative relationship, indicating that higher SELIC rates are associated with lower real estate sales in the short term.:
\[
\hat{y}_t = \hat{y}_{t-1} + \Bigl[
    \underbrace{55.12}_{c} 
    + \underbrace{(-143.8)}_{\beta}\,x_t 
    + \underbrace{0.55}_{\phi_1}\,\bigl(\hat{y}_{t-1} - \hat{y}_{t-2}\bigr)
    + \underbrace{\gamma}_{\approx 0.3\;(\text{double if }t<5)}\,\Bigl(y_{t-1}^\mathrm{Real} - \hat{y}_{t-1}\Bigr)
\Bigr].
\]
Here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(c = 55.12\) is the constant.
    \item \(\beta = -143.8\) is the coefficient quantifying the effect of the SELIC rate \(x_t\).
    \item \(\phi_1 = 0.55\) reflects the influence of the previous forecasted change.
    \item \(\gamma \approx 0.3\) (1dp) is the correction factor (with an early adjustment by doubling for \(t<5\) as needed).
\end{itemize}
After computing each \(\hat{y}_t\), a 2-month moving average is applied to both the real and forecasted data to smooth out abrupt fluctuations.

\textbf{Overview of the Path Taken.}\\[1mm]
The analysis began with polynomial regressions, which revealed a strong negative slope (approximately \(-145\)) but also large monthly residuals. The ARIMAX(1,1,1) model then provided highly accurate one-step-ahead forecasts by integrating the SELIC rate, autoregressive differencing, and moving-average error feedback. To understand the contribution of each element, a deterministic Euler recursion was derived from the ARIMAX model. However, omitting the noise-feedback term (\(\theta_1\,\varepsilon_{t-1}\)) resulted in catastrophic negative drift. To counteract this, partial feedback (\(\gamma\,E_{t-1}\)) was reintroduced, along with an early adjustment for \(t<5\). Finally, a 2-month moving average was applied to smooth the series, which improved stability for \(t \geq 10\). This stepwise process underscores the importance of each component in achieving both stability and interpretability.

\textbf{Methodological Weaknesses and Limitations.}\\[1mm]
Despite the robust short-run performance of the model, several limitations remain:

    \textbf{Dependence on Real Data:} The approach relies on actual data \(y_{t-1}^\mathrm{Real}\) to compute the correction factor, making it best suited for rolling one-step forecasts. Multi-step forecasts may compound errors.
    \textbf{Ad Hoc Early Adjustment:} Doubling \(\gamma\) for \(t<5\) or re-anchoring the forecast when residuals exceed a threshold is somewhat arbitrary, lacking a rigorous statistical basis.
    \textbf{Simplistic Smoothing:} The 2-month moving average smooths the data but may mask abrupt changes (e.g., sudden jumps in SELIC), potentially delaying timely responses.
    \textbf{Limited Exogenous Variables:} Focusing solely on SELIC may overlook other influential factors such as holidays, consumer confidence, or macroeconomic shifts.
    \textbf{Short Sample Window:} With only 24 months of data, the model's parametric stability is uncertain, especially under large macroeconomic changes.


\textbf{Real-World Significance and Final Outlook.}\\[1mm]
The final equation is optimal for short-term, rolling monthly forecasts under stable conditions with regularly updated data. It captures the negative relationship between SELIC interest rates and property sales—supporting the economic theory that higher rates reduce property purchases. Specifically, a 1 percentage point increase in SELIC is associated with approximately 144 fewer monthly property closings. Although the model includes monthly corrections and smoothing via a 2-month moving average, it has limitations regarding long-term forecasts and sensitivity to abrupt policy shifts. Future improvements could involve refining the adjustment thresholds or integrating additional macroeconomic variables to enhance robustness. Nonetheless, the current model successfully demonstrates the concept of negative interest-rate elasticity on a short-term basis, accommodating real-world complexities like data availability and sudden changes.
